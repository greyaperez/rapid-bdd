### "A simplified and fresh approach to Behavioral Driven Development."

In it's most rudimentary form, Rapid BDD is a dynamic Step/Page Object Selector Framework intended to cover most step scenarios:

  - Start Writing Tests Immediately
  - Context Aware Page Object Auto Selectors
  - Built on top of Node, Protractor, Cucumber and Chai
